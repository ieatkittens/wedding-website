                            <p>In 2013, Miranda took a job at G Adventures, looking to restart a career in travel that she had previously set aside.  During her first week, she tried to strike up a conversation with Sam, who largely ignored her at the time because he was engrossed in a game of Galaga.  He didn't get the high score, but by the end of the night he did have an inkling that he had met someone very, very special.  Two years later, and it's hard to believe that they've ever been apart.</p>

                            <h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                            <p>Visiting the Azores, the home of Miranda's Father, Sam is constantly checking to make sure he hasn't lost the ring.  It's a small vintage piece, wrapped in emeralds and exactly in Miranda's size, and though he knows he is going to propose in Portugal, he has yet to figure out how.</p>

                            <p>It's Christmas.  Miranda has an obsession with After-Eight chocolates, and though she had bought a box to bring along, she forgot to pack it.  Woe!  Christmas is surely ruined.</p>

                            <p>By some small miracle, while out wandering in the shops, Sam stumbles across a box of the precious mints tucked away on the bottom shelf in a corner store.  He scoops it up, pays for it while Miranda is distracted, and stuffs it into his bag.  He hatches a plan - removes a chocolate from it's wrapper and replaces it with the ring, then wraps the box and sets it aside for Christmas morning.</p>

                            <p>Miranda was a little disappointed when the first chocolate she pulled out appeared to have been pilfered, but was ecstatic to find the ring in it's place, and gave Sam an enthusiastic Yes.</p>

                                Northbound from Toronto <br /><br />

                                Take Highway 400 North.  Once you're through Barrie, the Highway will split into the 400 extension and Highway 11 - stay left to merge onto Highway 11 (ON-11).  Follow Highway 11 for 100km, until you come to South Mary Lake road (you'll see a Home Hardware on the right), then turn right to head towards Port Stanley.  Follow this until it hooks left along the river, then take your first right onto District Road 10, and another right almost immediately onto Deer Lake Road (District Road 46).  In just under a kilometer, you'll see Clearwater Lake Road, which will take you the remaining 4km to the Trillium Resort and Spa.

                                Eastbound from Newfoundland<br /><br />

                                You should probably fly.  Sam has been sitting in his car in a ditch in a snowstorm on the East Coast during a road trip, and he wouldn't recommend it.

                            <h2>HISTORY OF THE INN</h2>
                            <p>
                                Ninety years ago, construction began on La Morada (“dwelling” in Spanish), the first building in what would become Rancho Santa Fe. Now known as The Inn at Rancho Santa Fe, “The Inn” to locals, it was then a guesthouse for prospective land buyers, a place to “put them up” while they looked at lots owned by the Santa Fe Land Improvement Company. The company, a subsidiary of the Santa Fe Railway, had bought up parcels, planting eucalyptus trees for railroad spikes. But as history has so often shown, not everything goes according to plan. The wood, the company discovered, was too soft to hold the spikes. It was on to plan B.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That plan turned out to be fortuitous. It led to the master-planned community of Rancho Santa Fe, designed by Lilian Rice, a National City-born architect and U.C. Berkeley graduate, who would earn acclaim for her signature Spanish Colonial Revival style. Rice designed the village’s key commercial and residential buildings, many now considered so historically significant that they are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

                                Throughout the decades The Inn has been a favorite destination for many years of famous and influential people.  In 1932, singer-actor Bing Crosby purchased one of Juan Osuna’s original adobes with 50 acres, and hired Lilian Rice as his architect. Legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright was married in the parlor of the Inn in 1928.

                                Just as the architecture of the missions tells a story about the history of California, so does Lilian Rice’s legendary design of The Inn. It is a perfect representation of old California charm and Rice's belief that true beauty lies in simplicity rather than ornateness. The Inn is a perfect reflection of Rice's dream - a place where time stands still amidst the simplistic, natural beauty that is Rancho Santa Fe.  &nbsp;&nbsp;
