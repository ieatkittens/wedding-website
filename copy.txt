How We Met

In 2013, Miranda took a job at G Adventures, looking to 

restart a career in travel that she had previously set 

aside.  During her first week, she tried to strike up a 

conversation with Sam, who largely ignored her at the 

time because he was engrossed in a game of Galaga.  He 

didn't get the high score, but by the end of the night 

he did have an inkling that he had met someone very, 

very special.  Two years later, and it's hard to 

believe that they've ever been apart.



The Engagement

Visiting the Azores, the home of Miranda's Father, Sam 

is constantly checking to make sure he hasn't lost the 

ring.  It's a small vintage piece, wrapped in emeralds 

and exactly in Miranda's size, and though he knows he 

is going to propose in Portugal, he has yet to figure 

out how.  

It's Christmas.  Miranda has an obsession with After-

Eight chocolates, and though she had bought a box to 

bring along, she forgot to pack it.  Woe!  Christmas is 

surely ruined. 

By some small miracle, while out wandering in the 

shops, Sam stumbles across a box of the precious mints 

tucked away on the bottom shelf in a corner store.  He 

scoops it up, pays for it while Miranda is distracted, 

and stuffs it into his bag.  He hatches a plan - 

removes a chocolate from it's wrapper and replaces it 

with the ring, then wraps the box and sets it aside for 

Christmas morning.

Miranda was a little disappointed when the first 

chocolate she pulled out appeared to have been 

pilfered, but was ecstatic to find the ring in it's 

place, and gave Sam an enthusiastic Yes.
